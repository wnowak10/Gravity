We need to be clearer about ultimate aims of teaching.

 
Most young students struggle to motivate, and we poke and prod them as a result. "Do math. Like math. Love math!" Popular culture paints academia as uncool, and we paint it as productive, beautiful, and worthy.

When we overcome the first hurdle, we realize there are more to overcome. When students come to like math, they eventually take too much pride in it. With insincere self deprecation, they will say "aw shucks, I'm a math nerd!" or "No really guys, math is cool!". But this self-effacement is actually pride manifest. They have done what was asked of them, and have safely arrived on the side of success and goodness, as they see it.

But this is a mistake, and the blame lies with teachers and schools. When a student spends all day studying math, they should have an awareness of the selfishness inherent in this privleged activity. To be able to devote oneself to the study of math is a luxury. But, crucially, having been reared in a world where math was stigmatized, the students naturally don't see it as such. 

We, as teachers, need to be clear. Loving math, and seeing it for its beauty and application is surely "good". But our students must then acknowledge that this academic skill is to be used for a higher purpose.
