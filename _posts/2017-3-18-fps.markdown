Out of curiosity, I was wondering at what speed Processing rendered video. My google search of "how many frames per second is processing?" displayed that the primary search for "how many frames per second is real life?". An awesome search, and I didn't know the answer.

This led me [here](http://nerdist.com/your-brain-has-a-frame-rate-and-its-pretty-slow/). Lots of cool stuff, but this was my favorite.   

> “But at least humans don’t see life like stop-motion animation. “Booralana tricarinata, a deep-sea cousin of the roly-poly, boasts the lowest known C.F.F. (Critical Flicker Frequency): four flashes a second. Its view of life may be something like a fitful and grainy stop-motion film,” writes Ferris Jabr in [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-does-a-chicken-tell-time).”
