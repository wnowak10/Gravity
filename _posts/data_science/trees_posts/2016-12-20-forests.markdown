Here was the plan. 

* [How do vanilla tree algorithms even work](#algorithms)
	* [For categorical dependent variables](#categorical) 
	* [For numerical dependent variables](#numerical)
* [Why random forests are useful and what ensembles are](#forests)
* How gradient boosting applies
* What bagging is

In part 1, I looked at the basic setup for tree algorithms. Here's part 2!
