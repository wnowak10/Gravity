If you look at [Kaggle](kaggle.com) competitions, you can quick glean that XGBoost (in Python or R) is hugely popular and successful in solving classification problems.

I am familiar with the idea of a decision tree, which is powerful in its simplicity. But the added complexity of something like XGBoost is a bit beyond me. In particular, I don't fully understand:

* Algorithms that power a plain old, vanilla decision tree. 
* Why random forests are useful.
* How gradient boosting applies.
* What bagging is?

So, here's the plan. 

1. If you need a primer on how a decision tree works, there is a lot of good extant content on this. Check out this simple [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKD5gxPPeY0) for an explanation of the basic idea. 

2. Assuming the decision trees are understood, I am going to address the questions above, while also talking about the process through which I do so. 

So, let's begin...

My understanding is that vanilla decision trees work by looking at data (which can be categorical or quantitive in nature), and finding the most information rich split. For example, if I were trying to classify morning beverage using "Temperature" and "Cloud cover" as classifiers (as shown in the following table)

<a>
	<img src="/images/coffeetable.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 357px; height: 365px"/>
</a>


What would be the optimal first split for the tree?

<a>
	<img src="/images/keep-calm-and-think-about-it-17.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px; height: 700px"/>
</a>

Actually, did you think about it? Hopefully.

We can see that splitting on the temp is the best call, as if temps are below 80, we can correctly bin every beverage choice. We don't even need the information provided about the cloud cover. 


<a>
	<img src="/images/classified_coffee.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 350; height: 350"/>
</a>

This basic split shows the "tree" idea:

How does the computer actually do this?
